# Electron macOS wallpaper app
Wallpaper is a simple macOS app built with AngularJS/Electron that sits in your menubar and automatically refreshes your wallpaper with beautiful high-resolution photos from unsplash.com. The app allows you to automatically refresh your wallpaper every hour, day, or week. You can also choose wallpaper categories.

If you wish to just install the app, the file is available for download [here](https://github.com/andypotts/macos-wallpaper-app/raw/build/Wallpaper.zip). *Please note, when I installed the app from this download link the app didn't work until I moved it into and ran it from the applications folder.*
